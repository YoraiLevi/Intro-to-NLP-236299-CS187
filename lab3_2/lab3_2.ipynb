        "# The CKY recognition algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "The CKY algorithm is a simple *[dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)* algorithm. Dynamic programming algorithms work by solving every subproblem of a given problem, in an order such that larger subproblems can merely recombine solutions of smaller subproblems already solved. In the case of CNF parsing, the subproblems are the parsing of _every substring_ as _every nonterminal_. In the end, of course, all we care about is whether the _entire string_ can be parsed as _the start nonterminal_. But by calculating all of the subproblems in order from the shortest to the longest substrings, we can acquire the information we need in the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "> You may recall that Viterbi's algorithm is also a dynamic programming algorithm, solving all subproblems of finding, for each prefix of a sequence and each state, the maximum probability of the prefix where the last word was emitted by the state.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://github.com/nlp-course/data/raw/master/Resources/cky-chart.png\" width=400 align=right />\n",
        "\n",
        "We start by representing the string to be parsed in such a way that we can represent each of its substrings compactly. Consider the string `one plus two times three`. We can think of the positions between the words as being numbered from zero to the length of the string (5), as depicted in the figure at right. Then any substring can be characterized by the string position to its left and the string position to its right, which we'll call a _span_. For instance, the substring `one plus` corresponds to the span 0–2 and `two times three` to the span 2–5. Adjacent spans (like these two) share a string position, in this case the string position 2, which corresponds to the \"split point\" that divides the spans. Two adjacent spans can be combined to form a longer one; the full span is between the left string position of the left span and the right string position of the right span, 0–5.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some substrings are generated by the grammar from particular nonterminals. For instance, in the example at right, the substring in the span 0–2 is generated by the grammar as an `SOP`, and 2–5 as an `S`. We'll call a span generable by a particular nonterminal a _potential constituent_.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CKY algorithm proceeds by generating every potential subconstituent of the string to be parsed. It does so by filling in a table `T` indexed by two string positions (a span, specifying a substring) whose entries are sets of nonterminals that can generate the substring between the string positions. Thus, the algorithm in parsing the string `one plus two times three` will place `SOP` in the table at entry `T[0, 2]` and `S` at entry `T[2, 5]` (among other entries). It follows from these two entries, plus the existence of a rule `S -> SOP S` in the grammar, that there should also be an entry `S` in `T[0, 5]`. By filling in these table entries in a particular order, making use of entries previously filled out, the full set of potential subconstiuents can be determined, and hence, the particular question of whether `S` covers the entire string can be answered simply by inspecting `T[0, N]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the CKY algorithm in pseudo-code:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        " 1.  define cky-parse(string = w1, ..., wN, grammar):\n",
        " 2.      for j in [1..N]:                     # each end string position\n",
        "\n",

        " 3.          for all A where A --> wj in grammar:\n",

        "\n",

        " 5.          for length in [2..j]:            # each subconstituent length\n",
        " 6.              i := j - length              # start string position\n",
        " 7.              for split in [i+1..j-1]      # each split point\n",
        " 8.                  for all A where \n",
        " 9.                          A -> B C is a rule in the grammar\n",
        "10.                          and B in T[i, split]\n",
        "11.                          and C in T[split, j]:\n",
        "12.                      add A to T[i, j]\n",
        "13.      if S in T[0, N] then parsed else failed\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is that we parse the sentence bottom-up, where in every step we check whether a given subsequence of the input can be derived from any single nonterminal. If we perform this in the right order (as above), at every step we already know whether each of the possible splits of the subsequence creates valid subparses.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you'll carry out the CKY algorithm **manually**. \n",
        "\n",
        "> Note that in the pseudo-code above, the CKY algorithm runs column by column, and in each column from bottom to top row, while in the lecture you saw that it calculates the diagonals from bottom to top. This difference doesn't matter at all since the content of each cell depends only on the cells to its left and the ones beneath.\n",
        "\n",
        "> A detail concerning implementing the algorithm in Python, with its zero-based indexing: Zero-based indexing works quite naturally for the table `T`, since the string positions start with zero. However, the input sentence itself uses one-based indexing, that is, the first word in the input sentence is denoted as `w1` in the pseudo-code. To make it easier to follow the algorithm, we can match our indices to the algorithm's by adding a dummy symbol at the start of the sentence."

We recursively construct all possible parse trees based on the `A1` nonterminal covering `[0, k1]` and all possible parse trees based on `B1` covering `[k1, 5]`. Then for each of the `A1` and `B1` trees, we construct a tree (using parentheses notation) of the form `(S (A1 ...) (B1 ...))`. We do the same for the other option `(k2, A2, B2)`. In this way, we'll generate all parse trees for the string.\n",
        "\n",
        "As it turns out, for the particular string we've been using, there is only one parse tree generable by each of the two options, so there are only two parse trees for the sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Start from `back[0, 5]`, and construct the two possible parse trees by using this method. Enter the two parses as `tree1` and `tree2` in the cell below.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note that as a convention we don't put quotation marks around terminals when we use `nltk.Tree.fromstring`. For example, if the tree has root `S` and two terminals `one` and `two`, then we construct the parse using `tree = nltk.Tree.fromstring(\"(S one two)\")` instead of `tree = nltk.Tree.fromstring(\"(S 'one' 'two')\")`.\n",
